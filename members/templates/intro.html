        <p>
            Python is a powerful, versatile, and beginner-friendly programming language. It has gained widespread popularity in various fields, making it an ideal choice for newcomers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Python's clear and readable syntax simplifies the process of learning and writing code, making it a great language for beginners. Here are some key points to consider:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1. Readability:</strong> Python's code is highly readable and resembles plain English, which makes it easy to understand and write.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2. Versatile:</strong> Python is versatile and can be used for web development, data analysis, scientific computing, automation, artificial intelligence, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>3. Strong Community:</strong> Python has a vast and active community that offers support, extensive documentation, and numerous libraries to help you in your programming journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you're interested in web development, data science, or creating your own projects, Python is a great choice for anyone starting their programming journey.
        </p>

        <p> let see first program in python for better Understanding</p>
    </div>
    <div class="code">
        # Script Begins<br>
        <br>
        print("GeeksQuiz")<br>
        <br>
        # Scripts Ends
    </div>
    <p>
        Output:
    </p>
    <div class="code">
        GeeksQuiz
    </div>
    <p>
        Let’s analyze the script line by line.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Line 1:</strong> [# Script Begins] In Python, comments begin with a #. This statement is ignored by the interpreter and serves as documentation for our code.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Line 2:</strong> [print("GeeksQuiz")] To print something on the console, print() function is used. This function also adds a newline after our message is printed (unlike in C). Note that in Python 2, “print” is not a function but a keyword and therefore can be used without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function and must be invoked with parentheses.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Line 3:</strong> [# Script Ends] This is just another comment like in Line 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        Python, designed by Guido van Rossum at CWI, has become a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.
    </p>
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
        Knowledge of any programming language can be a plus.
    </p>
    <h2>Reason for Increasing Popularity</h2>
    <p>
        Python's increasing popularity can be attributed to several factors, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Emphasis on code readability and shorter, more concise code.</li>
        <li>Programmers can express logical concepts in fewer lines of code compared to languages such as C++ or Java.</li>
        <li>Python supports multiple programming paradigms, such as object-oriented, imperative, functional, and procedural programming.</li>
        <li>There exist built-in functions for almost all frequently used concepts.</li>
        <li>The philosophy of Python is "Simplicity is the best," which contributes to its ease of use and approachability for newcomers.</li>
    </ul>
